    title: 'Provider trim and chat timeline fixes',
    highlights: [
      'Providers narrowed to ProjectRose (managed) and Ollama (local) — Anthropic, OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and OpenAI-compatible options have been removed',
      'Ollama now holds a single model name instead of a list — pick it once under Settings → Providers → Ollama',
      'Router removed entirely; every chat goes to the configured model with no classification step',
      'Settings → Providers loses the Behavior & Context section; the compression toast still fires automatically and the never-used thinking-in-context and inline-tool-result toggles are gone',
      'Existing API keys, OpenAI-compatible base URLs, and the legacy model catalogue are dropped from settings on first launch (the previously-default Ollama model is preserved)',
      'Google integration now works out of the box in official builds — just sign in; there\'s no longer any need to create your own Google Cloud OAuth credentials. Builds without bundled keys (e.g. self-built) still let you paste your own under Settings → Providers → Google',
      'The Compress button now summarises the whole conversation, not just the older turns — the automatic suggestion still keeps your most recent turns verbatim',
      'Compressed turns collapse behind a single divider so it\'s obvious they were summarised; expand it any time to read the originals',
      'Fix: blank assistant cells no longer appear when the agent finishes a step with only thinking and tool calls',
      'Fix: the Compress button now reports its result (or why it can\'t run) instead of silently doing nothing',
      'Fix: chat messages no longer have their own inner scrollbars — long messages, thinking blocks, and tool output now flow into a single timeline scroll instead of nesting scroll areas'
    ]

  {
    version: '1.9.0',
    tag: null,

    highlights: [
      'New built-in Contacts extension — list and edit people in agent memory, with two-way Google Contacts sync',
      'New built-in Email extension — single-account inbox and compose over IMAP/SMTP or Gmail, with a heuristic prompt-injection quarantine for incoming mail',
      'New built-in Calendar extension — create, edit, and list events in agent memory, with two-way Google Calendar sync and agent tools for scheduling',
      'Built-in extensions ship inside the app and are always available — no install step, no per-workspace enable toggle'
    ]

  {
    version: '1.6.0',
    tag: null,
    date: null,
    title: 'Editor returns, smoother voice, and macOS fixes',
    highlights: [
      'Editor is back — switch between Bloom and Editor from the ProjectRose menu in the top-left; your choice is remembered across launches and the chat panel stays visible alongside the editor',
      'The floating dock button now slides over the editor instead of pushing its content up',
      'Active listening and the speech session feel smoother',
      'Extensions install once but enable, disable, and configure separately in each workspace',
      'Fix: macOS app opens from Finder again — a language-server crash on launch is resolved',
      'Fix: unsigned macOS builds now launch',
      'Fix: extensions installed in older versions are no longer blocked at startup',
      'Fix: the .projectrose workspace folder is always created when you open a project',
      'Fix: scheduled-task code no longer leaks into unrelated parts of the app',
      'Fix: removed a stale "default project" button on the welcome screen',
      'Fix: assistant message rendering edge case',
      'Improving code architecture under the hood for a more maintainable foundation'

      'When you\'re signed in, chats automatically use your account; sign out and your other providers come back',
      'Your sign-in is saved securely on your device',
      'New Concrete CMS extension in the in-app discovery page',
      'Bottom dock button can be repositioned to your preferred spot',
      'Settings page now spans the full window — the chat panel hides while you\'re in Settings to give settings more room',
      'Dock settings cog flips to the inner side of the main button when you drag it toward an edge, so the button itself stays closest to the screen edge',
      'App Board got a refresh — lighter background and a divider under the title for a cleaner look',
      'Extension settings pages have proper spacing so text no longer hugs the edge',
      'Fix: the compression toast no longer keeps reappearing after you click Compress'
